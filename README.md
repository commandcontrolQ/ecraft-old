# IMPORTANT INFO

- When you create a new world, you may be stuck on a black screen or you may spawn falling through the ground. **DO NOT WORRY, THE GAME IS NOT BROKEN, IT IS JUST LOADING.**
  - *Especially on low-end hardware*, ECraft may take a long time to render your world, so you will have to be patient. Wait at least 5 minutes before "giving up" on a new world.
- I am not the original creator of ECraft. This repository is only to archive the game.
